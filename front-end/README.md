- Angular
  - Note: Initially I started with a vanilla JS observer + modules pattern, but things got a bit funky. To keep within the suggested timeframe for the project, I was thinking of choosing either Preact (the lightweight sibling of React) or Angular, 
    and I opted for the highly-opinionated one in terms of project structure. Especially for PoC's and rapid prototyping, I sometimes found that an opinionated framework helps me focus more on being creative and getting my ideas out there fast, and not tinker too much.
- SCSS
- BEM
- ExpressJS
- Jasmine for unit tests
- TypeScript

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
